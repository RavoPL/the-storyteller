# The Storyteller
Developed by **Dorian Wolarz**, a Code Institute Student

*The Storyteller is a Full Stack website which works as a mini blog. Users can create personal accounts and afterwards they can create, share and comment on each other's short stories. In a general sense it will be a very primitive version of WordPress or WattPad.*
